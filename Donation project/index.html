            Education is fundamental for achieving full human potential, developing an equitable and just society, and promoting national development.

            Every child, no matter who they are or where they come from, deserves access to quality learning opportunities â€“ from the age of three years when they begin to acquire early learning skills to the end of their school education at age 18. Through several state-level programmes and national policy advocacy, Save the Children has supported the education of millions of children since 2008! We address children's learning needs through an inclusive, equitable, safe learning environment for children between 3-18 years for an active, purposeful adult life.</p>
